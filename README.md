Hi, Iâ€™m @mudkipz1

This is a dumping ground of various code projects with no real goal in mind. Just exploring ideas to learn

Some of these scripts might be incomplete or still being tested. I'm highly interested in getting my foot in the door with blueteam operations (SOC Analyst, etc) and I've been told this is a good way of showing what I can do......

Some things in here might be re-inventing the wheel but I find to be a good way of exploring ideas. 

Some things are really old files from my CompSci class to chuck up here to show exposure to languages I don't really touch all that much anymore. 

I'm always open to feedback, and I personally prefer heavily critical feedback. If my code is straight shit, tell me, but be constructive about it. I'm still new so "good practices" aren't second nature.
